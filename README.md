#### **Introduction**  
Event marketing is an essential part of organizing any successful event. With the help of Generative AI, it is possible to automate the creation of promotional content, saving time and effort for event organizers. Generative AI uses advanced machine learning models to produce text, images, and other content that can be used in marketing campaigns.  

In this project, we aim to create a tool that will help event organizers by generating posts, banners, and email content automatically. This tool will also assist in sharing content on different platforms and tracking the success of campaigns.

#### **Scope Definition**  
Event organizers often face challenges in creating effective promotional material due to limited time, resources, and design skills. As a result, they struggle to reach their audience and ensure the success of their events. This project aims to address these challenges by developing an AI-powered event marketing tool that automates the creation and distribution of marketing content.

The proposed solution will leverage Generative AI to produce engaging posts, banners, and emails based on simple event details. Users will also be able to schedule posts, send invitations, and track campaign performance. The project will use technologies like OpenAI's GPT for text generation, DALL·E for image creation, and web development tools like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Python with FastAPI for implementation.
